README for the containerized graph viewer app v 0.1 

Docker launches a server that you can access at localhose:8050 

The command to do this (w/ an appropriate docker image - docker build _appname_ ) 

docker run -p 8050:8050 -v "$(pwd)"/app:/app --rm 3d_container

(Here, the options are important, especially -p and -v)

To build the image, make sure Docker is installed and run 

`docker build -t 3d_container .`

(Here, the . for the working directory is important)
